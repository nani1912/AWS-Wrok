AWS VPC :(Virtual Private Cloud)
************************************
Your instance will be able to communicate with the Internet, 
and you'll be able to access your instance from your local computer using SSH (if it's a Linux instance) or Remote Desktop (if it's a Windows instance). 

launched your instance into a public subnet — a subnet that has a route to an Internet gateway. However, 
the instance in your subnet also needs a public IPv4 address to be able to communicate with the Internet. 
By default, an instance in a nondefault VPC is not assigned a public IPv4 address.

Step 1: Create the VPC:
***********************

1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-1
2. choose Start VPC Wizard. 
3. Choose the first option, VPC with a Single Public Subnet, and then choose Select
4. On the configuration page, enter a name for your VPC in the VPC name field; for example, my-vpc, and 
enter a name for your subnet in the Subnet name field. 
This helps you to identify the VPC and subnet in the Amazon VPC console after you've created them
  Options on configuration page:
  a. The IPv4 CIDR block: displays the IPv4 address range that you'll use for your VPC (10.0.0.0/16), and 
     the Public subnet's IPv4 CIDR field displays the IPv4 address range you'll use for the subnet (10.0.0.0/24).
  b. The Availability Zone: list enables you to select the Availability Zone in which to create the subnet. 
     You can leave No Preference to let AWS choose an Availability Zone for you. 
  c. the Service endpoints section:  you can select a subnet in which to create a VPC endpoint to Amazon S3 in the same region.
  d. The Enable DNS hostnames option: when set to Yes, ensures that instances that are launched into your VPC receive a DNS hostname.
  e. The Hardware tenancy option: enables you to select whether instances launched into your VPC are run on shared or dedicated hardware.
5. We can view our newly launched VPC's in "Your VPCs page"


Step 2: Create a Security Group :
*********************************

A security group acts as a virtual firewall to control the traffic for its associated instances. 
To use a security group, you add the inbound rules to control incoming traffic to the instance, and 
outbound rules to control the outgoing traffic from your instance. To associate a security group with an instance, 
you specify the security group when you launch the instance. If you add and remove rules from the security group, 
we apply those changes to the instances associated with the security group automatically.

1. Allows inbound HTTP access from any IPv4 address (80), Allows inbound HTTPS access from any IPv4 address (443). and Allows inbound SSH access from your home network to a Linux/UNIX instance(22)
2. In the navigation pane, choose Security Groups.
3. Choose Create Security Group. 
4. In the Group name field, enter *WebServerSG*(its our wish) as the name of the security group, and provide a description.
5. After create select and Inbound Rules tab, choose Edit.
6. Allow step 1

Step 3: Launch an Instance into Your VPC :
******************************************

When you launch an EC2 instance into a VPC, you must specify the subnet in which to launch the instance. 
In this case, you'll launch an instance into the public subnet of the VPC you created. 
You'll use the Amazon EC2 launch wizard in the Amazon EC2 console to launch your instance. 

1. Lauch an instance with new keypair (easy for connecting)
2. On the Configure Instance Details page, select the VPC that you created from the Network list, and the subnet from the Subnet list.
3. On the Add Tags page, you can tag your instance with a Name tag; for example Name=MyWebServer. 
   This helps you to identify your instance in the Amazon EC2 console after you've launched it.

   
Step 4: Assign an Elastic IP Address to Your Instance :
*******************************************************

Launched your instance into a public subnet — a subnet that has a route to an Internet gateway. 
However, the instance in your subnet also needs a public IPv4 address to be able to communicate with the Internet. 
By default, an instance in a nondefault VPC is not assigned a public IPv4 address.

1. On VPC console choose Elastic IPs and create.
2. In the dialog box, choose Instance from the Associate with list, 
   and then select your instance from the Instance list. Choose Yes, Associate when you're done. 

   
To terminate your instance, release your Elastic IP address, and delete your VPC
1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/. 
2. In the navigation pane, choose Instances. 
3. Select your instance, choose Actions, then Instance State, and then select Terminate. 
4. In the dialog box, expand the Release attached Elastic IPs section, and select the check box next to the Elastic IP address. Choose Yes, Terminate. 
5. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/. 
6. In the navigation pane, choose Your VPCs. 
7. Select the VPC, choose Actions, and then choose Delete VPC. 
8. When prompted for confirmation, choose Yes, Delete.
